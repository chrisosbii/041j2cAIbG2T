## Bonuses:
* High Score lists will order itself by scores
* Added about 10 questions and right now it randomly picks 5 of them

## Regrests:
* Score is based purly on if you answered a question as fast as you can
* Would have liked to made the answer buttons have a scrambled order
* Better colors
* timer does not end right away sometimes I assume this is an issue with where the count is happening
* score currently does not go negative if you just run out of time and don't answer any questions
